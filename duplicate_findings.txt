DUPLICATE SECTIONS FOUND:

1. MemberDashboard.tsx:
   - "Community Feed" appears TWICE: once as Quick Action card (line 48, "Submit Testimony" etc grid) AND as separate section (line 239-270) with "Browse Community Feed" button
   - "Live Events" appears TWICE: once as Quick Action card (line 85-93) AND as separate "Upcoming Events" section (line 273-316) with "Become a Founder" button
   
2. Membership.tsx:
   - "Everything in Free, plus:" still in founderFeatures (line 119) - user asked to remove this earlier
   - "Ready to Join Your Spiritual Family?" CTA section (line 279-313) is very similar to Home.tsx CTA (line 232-266) - same heading text
   - The createCheckout mutation (lines 35-48) is still there but unused since we switched to direct links

3. Home.tsx:
   - "Ready to Join Your Spiritual Family?" CTA (line 236) duplicates the same section in Membership.tsx (line 283)
   - Hero CTA buttons (Join Free + Become a Founder) duplicate the Final CTA buttons

ACTIONS:
- Remove duplicate Community Feed section from MemberDashboard
- Remove duplicate Upcoming Events section from MemberDashboard
- Remove "Everything in Free, plus:" from Membership founderFeatures
- Remove unused createCheckout mutation from Membership
