# Discovering Your Spiritual Gifts

**A Guide to Understanding and Developing Your God-Given Abilities**

## What Are Spiritual Gifts?

Spiritual gifts are special abilities given by the Holy Spirit to every believer for the purpose of building up the body of Christ. They are not natural talents (though God can sanctify those too)—they are supernatural enablements for ministry.

*"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work."* — 1 Corinthians 12:4-6

## How to Discover Your Gifts

### 1. Pray and Ask
The Holy Spirit wants you to know your gifts. Ask Him to reveal them.

*"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault."* — James 1:5

### 2. Experiment and Serve
Try different areas of ministry. Your gifts will become evident as you serve.

### 3. Notice What Energizes You
Spiritual gifts often align with spiritual passion. What ministry activities leave you feeling fulfilled rather than drained?

### 4. Listen to Others
Ask trusted believers what gifts they see in you. Often others can see what we cannot.

### 5. Look for Fruit
Where is God producing results through your service? Gifts bear fruit.
