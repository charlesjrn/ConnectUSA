# 7-Day Devotional for the Chosen

**A Journey of Faith, Purpose, and Divine Connection**

---

## Day 1: You Are Chosen

**Scripture:** *"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last."* — John 15:16

**Reflection:**
Before the foundation of the world, God knew you. He saw your face, knew your name, and chose you for a purpose that only you can fulfill. This isn't about being better than others—it's about being called for a specific mission.

**Prayer:**
Lord, help me understand the depth of Your choosing. When I feel inadequate or overlooked, remind me that You have appointed me for a purpose. Give me eyes to see the fruit You want to produce through my life. Amen.

**Action Step:**
Write down three ways you've seen God's hand guiding your life. Share one of these as a testimony with the Chosen Connect community.

## Day 2: Hearing His Voice

**Scripture:** *"My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me."* — John 10:27

**Reflection:**
God speaks. The question isn't whether He's talking, but whether we're listening. His voice comes through Scripture, through prayer, through circumstances, and through the counsel of other believers. Learning to recognize His voice is a lifelong journey.

**Prayer:**
Father, tune my ears to Your frequency. Help me distinguish Your voice from the noise of this world. Give me the patience to wait and the courage to act when You speak. Amen.

**Action Step:**
Spend 10 minutes in complete silence today. Don't ask for anything—just listen. Write down any impressions, thoughts, or scriptures that come to mind.

## Day 3: Walking in Your Gifts

**Scripture:** *"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms."* — 1 Peter 4:10

**Reflection:**
Your spiritual gifts aren't for your own benefit—they're tools for building up the body of Christ. Whether you have the gift of prophecy, teaching, encouragement, giving, leadership, or mercy, these are expressions of God's grace flowing through you.

**Prayer:**
Holy Spirit, reveal the gifts You've placed within me. Help me use them not for recognition, but for the building up of Your church. Remove any fear or pride that keeps me from stepping into my calling. Amen.

**Action Step:**
Update your Chosen Connect profile with your spiritual gifts. If you're unsure what they are, ask a trusted friend or mentor what gifts they see in you.

## Day 4: The Power of Testimony

**Scripture:** *"They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony."* — Revelation 12:11

**Reflection:**
Your testimony is a weapon. When you share what God has done in your life, you're not just telling a story—you're releasing spiritual power. Your testimony encourages others, defeats the enemy's lies, and glorifies God.

**Prayer:**
Lord, give me boldness to share my testimony. Help me remember the valleys You've brought me through and the mountains You've helped me climb. Let my story bring hope to someone who needs it today. Amen.

**Action Step:**
Share a testimony on Chosen Connect today. It doesn't have to be dramatic—even small moments of God's faithfulness matter.

## Day 5: Community of the Called

**Scripture:** *"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together."* — Hebrews 10:24-25

**Reflection:**
You weren't meant to walk this journey alone. God designed us for community—to encourage, challenge, and support one another. In a world that often misunderstands spiritual experiences, finding your tribe is essential.

**Prayer:**
Father, thank You for the gift of spiritual community. Help me be a source of encouragement to others. Show me who needs a word of hope today, and give me the courage to reach out. Amen.

**Action Step:**
Send a direct message to someone in the Chosen Connect community today. Offer a word of encouragement or ask how you can pray for them.

## Day 6: Visions and Dreams

**Scripture:** *"In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams."* — Acts 2:17

**Reflection:**
We live in the days of the outpouring. God is speaking through visions and dreams to His people. Don't dismiss what you see in the night or the impressions that come during prayer. Test them against Scripture, seek wise counsel, and steward them faithfully.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I open my heart to receive from You. If You want to show me something, I'm willing to see. Give me discernment to understand what You reveal and wisdom to know how to respond. Amen.

**Action Step:**
Keep a journal by your bed this week. Write down any dreams or visions you receive. Share them in the Visions section of Chosen Connect for community interpretation.

## Day 7: Walking in Purpose

**Scripture:** *"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."* — Ephesians 2:10

**Reflection:**
You are not an accident. You are God's masterpiece, created for specific works that He planned before you were born. Your purpose isn't something you need to create—it's something you need to discover and walk into.

**Prayer:**
Creator God, thank You for making me with intention. Help me discover the good works You've prepared for me. Remove any obstacles—internal or external—that keep me from walking in my full purpose. Amen.

**Action Step:**
Write a prayer request in the Prayer Room asking God to reveal the next step in your calling. Invite the community to pray with you.

## Closing Blessing

*May the God who chose you before the foundation of the world continue to reveal His purposes for your life. May you hear His voice clearly, walk in your gifts boldly, and find deep community with fellow believers. You are chosen. You are called. You are loved.*
